# Movie Recommendation System
## Overview
The aim of this project is to understand and implement the concepts of vectorization and cosine similarity for recommending movies based on user preferences. This project utilizes Python and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to achieve effective movie recommendations.

## Concepts Implemented
### Vectorization: Converting textual data into numerical vectors to facilitate similarity computations.
### Cosine Similarity: A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space, used to determine the relevance of movies to user preferences.

## Technologies Used
### Python: Programming language used for implementing the recommendation system.
### NLP: Techniques for processing and analyzing textual data.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/thehrsr/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system

### Install dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
Prepare Data: Ensure you have the movie dataset in the required format. The dataset should include movie titles and descriptions.

### Run the Recommendation System:

python recommend_movies.py

## Input Preferences: Follow the prompts to enter user preferences and receive movie recommendations based on cosine similarity.

## Project Structure
recommend_movies.py: Main script to run the recommendation system.
vectorization.py: Contains functions for vectorizing movie descriptions.
cosine_similarity.py: Functions for calculating cosine similarity.
data/: Directory for storing dataset files.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.

## Future Enhancements
User Feedback Integration: Incorporate user feedback to refine recommendations.
Advanced NLP Techniques: Use more sophisticated NLP techniques like embeddings for better accuracy.
Web Interface: Develop a web-based interface for easier interaction with the recommendation system.
